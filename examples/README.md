### Working Examples for Pyclivac

Use these examples to get familiar using python for climate science. There are a few examples working with table data (e.g. .cvs or .txt) and some examples working with netCDF data. We suggest the following order for working through the examples:

**1) netcdf_basics.ipynb**

This tutorial walks you through reading a netCDF file, running a basic computation on a variable, and making a single panel plot.

**2) multi_panel_plot_example**

This tutorial walks you through reading a netCDF file with the package xarray, running a basic computation, and making a variety of multi-panel plots.

**3) read_station_data_table_format.ipynb**

This tutorial walks you through reading a .csv file that contains time series data with the package pandas, running a basic computation and plotting a simple line plot.
