### Working Examples for Pyclivac

Use these examples to get familiar using python for climate science. There are a few examples working with table data (e.g. .cvs or .txt) and some examples working with netCDF data. We suggest the following order for working through the examples:

**1) python_fundamentals.ipynb

This tutorial gives a series of basic python examples that cover the python fundamentals.

**2) netcdf_and_cartopy.ipynb**

This tutorial walks you through reading a netCDF file, running a basic computation on a variable, and making a single panel plot.


**3) xarray_and_cartopy.ipynb**

This tutorial walks you through reading a netCDF file with the package xarray, running a computation on two variables, and making a variety of plots using filled contours, contour lines, and vector quivers. 

**4) multi_panel_plot_example.ipynb**

This tutorial walks you through reading a netCDF file with the package xarray, running a basic computation, and making a variety of multi-panel plots.

**5) read_station_data_table_format.ipynb**

This tutorial walks you through reading a .csv file that contains time series data with the package pandas, running a basic computation and plotting a simple line plot.

**6) colorbar_tutorial.ipynb**
This tutorial walks you through different options for choosing a colormap for your contour plots.

**7) time_lapse_video.ipynb**
This example shows you how to create a mp4 file from a series of contour plots over time.
